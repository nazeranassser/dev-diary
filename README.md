## My Dev Dairy
hello, I’m **Nazera Nasser** I’m a passionate web developer who loves creating websites and applications that solve real problems. I enjoy taking ideas and turning them into something people can interact with and use easily.
## Developer Mindset

To become a great software developer, it's not just about knowing code. Your mindset is just as important.

### Key Points:

- **Keep learning always**  
  Technology changes fast. I should never stop learning – books, tutorials, courses, or even from other developers.

- **Break problems into small parts**  
  Big problems are scary, but when I split them into smaller tasks, they become easier to solve.

- **Debug like a detective**  
  When bugs happen, I shouldn't guess. I need to look for clues, test ideas, and find the real reason.

- **Believe I can grow**  
  I may not be good at everything yet, but with practice, I’ll get better. Every expert was once a beginner.

- **Focus on user value**  
  Good code is nice, but what matters most is helping users and solving their problems.

- **Keep it simple**  
  Simple code is easier to read and fix later. I should avoid making things more complex than needed.

- **Make smart trade-offs**  
  Sometimes I have to choose between speed and quality. I should think about what’s most important now.

- **Plan for the future**  
  I must write clean, easy-to-update code, not just code that works today.

- **Think about future needs**  
  My code should be flexible and ready for changes, but not overly complicated.

- **Get feedback early**  
  I shouldn't wait until the end. I should show my work and get feedback while building.

- **Work well with others**  
  Development is teamwork. I need to communicate clearly, listen, and share ideas.

- **Use good design principles**  
  Organized code is easier to manage. I should follow rules like "one job per function" and keep modules separate.

- **Write readable code**  
  Code should be easy to understand. I’ll use clear names, comments, and clean structure.

- **Understand how things work**  
  I shouldn't treat tools or libraries as magic. Learning how things work helps me write better code and fix problems faster.

- **Automate boring stuff**  
  If I do the same thing over and over, I should try to write a script to do it for me.
